This is my first project in React Webdevelopment.
I used chatgpt to help me with CSS and HTMl

Shoppin is a single page webapp that can maintain your shopping list

User guide:

1. Chose your currancy on top right
2. Start adding your items to list, and each item will keep track of the estimated price
   Keep in mind that the estimated price is for whole quantity of the product but not per unit price
3. Depending on availability you can either chose to buy, or put the item in not available state later
   You can delete an item if you change your mind too
4. While moving item to bought by clicking "Buy" button, the app forces you to add the actual price
5. Once bought you can return it too incase you find it for cheaper somewhere else ;)
6. You can see the summary of the shopping cart at the end of the page and it keeps updating as you update
   the items status (buy, notavailable, delete)
